Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad
See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Oh, taking toll
If you've been bad
Oh, Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh, by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Oh
Bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad
See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Oh, taking toll
If you've been bad
Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh, by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Oh
Bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
